Sample, incomplete processor for Instagram posts (re socmed_collector):

for post in self.response_json['data'][:1]:
    post_id = post['id']
    title = 'Instagram Test Post'
    description = post['caption']['text']
    image_url = post['images']['standard_resolution']['url']

    # Save the image as a FileAsset so we can attach it to the Article to be created.
    file_asset = self.save_as_fileasset(post_id, image_url, title, description)
